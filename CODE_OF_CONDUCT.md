# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)

The short version: Be respectful, be kind, and help us create an open, welcoming, and harassment-free project.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, abusive language, or hateful speech
- Personal attacks, including insults and unwelcome sexual attention
- Disrespectful or exclusionary comments
- Publishing someone’s private information (doxing)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@summerdawn.ai. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

If the report indicates a safety risk we will act to remove the threat quickly. Possible actions include:

- Private warning or public warning
- Temporary or permanent ban from the project
- Removal of offensive comments or edits
- Referral to other authorities when appropriate

Decisions on enforcement are made at the discretion of the project maintainers and are final.

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting unacceptable behavior, please include:

- Your contact information (email or GitHub handle)
- Name(s) of the person(s) involved
- Date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the behavior (e.g., issue/PR/commit)
- Description and any supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, links)
- Whether you want the report to remain confidential

We will treat reports confidentially to the extent possible.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community (e.g., on social media, project mailing lists, or other online communities).
